# Wizard Adventure: Console Mini Game

**Wizard Adventure** is an exciting console-based mini-game developed in C++ with object-oriented programming. The player takes on the role of a wizard who must navigate through various levels, defeating enemies (ghosts).

The game also provides the choice to save or load a previous game.

- **Space Bar**: Destroy certain barriers.
- **X**: Exit or restart the game.
